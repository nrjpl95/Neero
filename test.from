Too bad Mr Crockford himself misunderstands Javascript.  For instance, he has ported lint to Javascript, but his 'jslint' will NOT account for the comma operator.  There go my for statements such as for (var i=0, n=arr.length; ....) newlinechar  newlinechar See http://www.crockford.com/jslint/lint.html
Sorry, not basic enough. How about explanations each step of the way of what U or f or n are?
well, I'm learning Python and so are all the guys in our huge team (well, 4 of us), so hopefully that will help next time around :)
Quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing about the battle over US schools.  Open up education to the free market, and you don't have this problem.  Do we hear about the 'Pizza eaters' battle to usurp lobster lovers in US restaurants?'  Or 'The rising costs of eating in the US?'  Or 'The failure of US restaurants to satiate their customers?' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Socialistic programs are expensive and provide service only to the common denominator.  Is your child more artistic and creative?  Too bad.  Do you want your child to learn how to run a business and be an entrepreneur?  Too bad.  Everyone is trying to control everyone else's children.

I'm wondering how my comment got 3 negative votes. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm trying to figure out what was wrong with me wondering aloud as to whether Bill Gates used modern langauges. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I expected maybe even a reply...but 3 negative votes? Come on, do some people give negative votes out of spite?
wow, this is the only practical use of fractals that I know of, are there others?
'hilarious' news piece from *2002*. Can you even buy these anymore?
Indeed - you just can't have casual discussions on Reddit. Everything has to be a profound insight into the workings of the universe, a Paul-Graham-ish mindblower of an idea, as if the people who read comments here are all busy professionals who are damn well doing you a *favour* by reading your commentary.
thats a dissadvantage ive been noticing too. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is no distinction implied by the site between interest or agreement. With the slashdot system you have reasons implied in each type of moderation. This doesnt prevent it from abuse but it encourages responsible use. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe it also has something to do with the scarcity of the mod points?
