Hmm, I tried the following, and it worked: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar for (var n=0, x=2; n&lt;10; n++, x++) { newlinechar  newlinechar     // trivial example newlinechar  newlinechar } newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Am I not getting something?
U is a combinator, a function that takes a function and returns another function. newlinechar  newlinechar f is a function that takes a number or function and returns a number or calls the function. newlinechar  newlinechar n is a number newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So U applies its argument to itself.  This means it makes a recursive function of its argument.  This means, in turn, that its argument must be a function capable of taking a functional argument.  Note that f fills this description.  So you can write a nonrecursive function (note that fact-nr is not recursive.), and then pass that nonrecursive function to U, which will make it a traditional recursive factorial, just like we have all written the first time we try out a  new lisp. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But why do all this?  If this were all there is to combinators, no one would use them.  But combinators can be used to fundamentally change the way function calls work in your language.  For instance, memoization can be an interesting technique-you can memorize the value of a function call, and then just return that when you get the same call again.  If your language supports combinators, you can hack in memoization yourself.  This is very cool.  I will try to write an essay about this, in my copious spare time. newlinechar  newlinechar 
The ranking claims to rate how 'mainstream' each language is, but in fact its a better indicator for age.
This isn't about socialism vs capitalism. It's about superstition being taught as science, and it's about separation of church and state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Free-market education?  There's plenty of private schools for rich kids.  Poor kids need an education too.  Either way, children deserve to be taught real science in science class.  The religious fundamentalists can teach creationism/ID in church and Sunday school where it belongs.
Because Bill Gates is a very intelligent man.
Indeed - you just can't have casual discussions on Reddit. Everything has to be a profound insight into the workings of the universe, a Paul-Graham-ish mindblower of an idea, as if the people who read comments here are all busy professionals who are damn well doing you a *favour* by reading your commentary.
A while back, lots of people were excited about fractal image compression - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression
nope, after I showed the link to my girlfriend she asked me to see how much they were... none listed on amazon.
thats a dissadvantage ive been noticing too. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is no distinction implied by the site between interest or agreement. With the slashdot system you have reasons implied in each type of moderation. This doesnt prevent it from abuse but it encourages responsible use. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe it also has something to do with the scarcity of the mod points?
On the other hand, it's not a popularity contest. I always thought it was silly to get all distraught. The voting is for recommendations, yes? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 'course, I've seen the word 'karma' around and if that's not a very, very complex system then yes, people are abusing that intent...
